 This method is gradually become a hot research in the machine learning field.
 To overcome these limitations, a new technique named as SVMCSD has been proposed for the detection of code smells, based on support vector machine learning technique.
 Four code smells are specified namely God Class, Feature Envy, Data Class and Long Method and the proposed technique is validated on two open source systems namely ArgoUML and Xerces.
 During the software maintenance, one of the widely used techniques to improve the software quality is refactoring (changing the inner structure of software system without changing its external behavior) [7].
 On the contrary, the Fowlers four code smells namely Data Class, Feature Envy, God Class, and Long Method are considered and evaluated using the proposed approach on ArgoUML and Xerces open source software system.
 Precision (P) and recall (R)software measures are used to compare the result of our approach with DETEX [13].
 Considering the full system, SVMCSD is able to detect more code smells as compare to DETEX.
 In this paper, we propose a novel technique to predict software quality by adopting support vector machine (SVM) in the classification of software modules based on complexity metrics.
 Several different techniques have been proposed to develop predictive software metrics for the classification of software program modules into fault-prone and non fault-prone categories.
 These techniques include discriminant analysis [4], [5], factor analysis [6], boolean discriminant functions [7], classification trees [8], [9], pattern recognition (Optimal Set Reduction, OSR) [4], [10], EM algorithm [11], feedforward neural networks [12], random forests [13], and many other methods [14].
 As software complexity metrics can be obtained relatively early in the software life-cycle, it is worthy to explore new techniques for early prediction of software quality based on software complexity metrics.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) [15] is a new technique for data classification, which has been used successfully in many object recognition applications [16], [17], [18], [19].
Thematic analysis is an approach that is often used for identifying, analyzing, and reporting patterns (themes) within data in primary qualitative research.
 'Thematic synthesis' draws on the principles of thematic analysis and identifies the recurring themes or issues from multiple studies, interprets and explains these themes, and draws conclusions in systematic reviews.
 This paper conceptualizes the thematic synthesis approach in software engineering as a scientific inquiry involving five steps that parallel those of primary research.
 The process and outcome associated with each step are described and illustrated with examples from systematic reviews in software engineering.
Research synthesis is a collective term for a family of methods that are used to summarize, integrate, combine, and compare the findings of primary studies on a specific topic or research question [15] [16].
 These methods embody the idea of making a new whole out of the parts to provide novel concepts and higher-order interpretations, novel explanatory frameworks, an argument, or new or enhanced theories or conclusions.
A number of different methods have been proposed for the synthesis of qualitative and mixed-methods findings such as the ones we typically find in software engineering (SE) (see [15] for an overview).
 Many of the these methods have much in common with meta-ethnography, as originally described by Noblit and Hare [37], and used in SE by Dybå and Dingsøyr [21].
 This method involves identifying key concepts from primary studies, comparing and translating them into higher-order interpretations.
Like meta-ethnography, many of the other synthesis methods are based on approaches used in primary research.
 Of these, thematic analysis stands out as it represents a range of potential methods for research synthesis that can be used with most, if not all, qualitative methods [8].
 Thematic analysis is also one of the most frequently used synthesis methods in SE; in a previous study we found that two-thirds of the systematic reviews in SE that synthesize their primary studies, performed a narrative or thematic analysis [15].
Recently, Thomas and Harden developed a new approach called thematic synthesis [42], which draws on the principles of thematic analysis and other established methods in primary qualitative research.
 The method was developed to address specific review questions about need, appropriateness, acceptability of interventions, and effectiveness.
 1 shows an overview of the synthesis process, while Table 2 describe the main steps and checklist items we propose for thematic synthesis in SE.
Information Retrieval (IR) methods, and in particular topic models, have recently been used to support essential software engineering (SE) tasks, by enabling software textual retrieval and analysis.
 In all these approaches, topic models have been used on software artifacts in a similar manner as they were used on natural language documents (e.
 Our paper builds on this new fundamental finding and proposes a novel solution to adapt, configure and effectively use a topic modeling technique, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to achieve better (acceptable) performance across various SE tasks.
 In all these approaches, LDA and LSI have been used on software artifacts in a similar manner as they were used on natural language documents (i.
 This fundamental new research finding explains in part why these fairly sophisticated IR methods showed rather low performance when applied on software data using parameters and configurations that were generally applicable for and tested on natural language corpora.
 Therefore, it can be useful to consider and use non-traditional teaching methods which can improve studentspsila learning.
 The Medical faculty at McMaster University in Canada introduced the tutorial process, not only as an explicit instructional method [5] but also as central to their philosophy for structuring an entire curriculum, promoting student-centered multidisciplinary education as a basis for lifelong learning in professional practices.
 This implies that, embedded software developers adopting a MDD approach are required to employ more than one modeling language to address the multi-faceted design aspects of an embedded software system.
 One sub-system is used for modeling the application level aspects and the other sub-system is used for dealing with the low-level/hardware-related continuous functions.
 However, such coupling methods are not applicable to all real-time operating systems and/or limited to a few simulation studies.
Test coverage is a effective approach of testing effectiveness and adequacy, which has positive impact on software reliability and defect coverage.
 In order to achieve a highly reliable software system, a number of software fault detection/removal techniques are widely used by the program developers or testing teams to detect and remove software faults.
 The fault detection rate is used to measure the effectiveness of fault detection for test techniques and test cases.
Quantitative evaluation of software reliability is an important part of software reliability engineering, and it can be concluded into two methods[1].
 These methods are applied in different phases of software development process, and its reliability prediction parameters generally include: the actual residual defective number of software, the failure density (failure number /KLOC) and so on.
 This method is mainly used in the software reliability validation and verification phases.
Those software reliability analytical engineers analyze many different software modeling methods, and wake up to know that: it is inaccurate for the assessment results that evaluating the reliability only based on the failure data from the software reliability test or predicting the software failure utilized with software quality measurement and influence factors in the software lifecycle alone.
 By applying the approach to requirement process, the domain knowledge can be captured in a well-defined way systematically from the very early stage.
 What's more, this method combines the advantages of operational profile model and the Markov model.
The basic method of constructing the profile of the operational structure is proposed by AT & T's John Mus.

 They propose to develop these using the traditional approach.
 The Agile software development methods are adopted to increase the success of the software projects.
 To avoid the risk of computer failures, a Tailor-made software technique was selected to meet the needs of specific SMEs user requirements.
 The waterfall approach was adopted because its process incorporates a linear approach allowing potential issues to be identified in the early phases.
Collecting, understanding, and managing requirements are critical aspects in all development methods including agile methods as well.
 SRS documents, non-functional requirements and user stories are parsed and used by the proposed approach to generate test cases in which requirements with different types are covered.
 The proposed approach uses text mining and symbolic execution methodology for test data generation and validation, where a knowledge base is developed for multi-disciplinary domains.
