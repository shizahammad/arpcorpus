Customer requirements are prioritized by the Product Owner representing the customer and stored in the product backlog.
To validate the efficacy of the technique introduced in this paper, 8 experiments were carried out including university, high school courses and companies from the software production sector.
In this phase, 2 experiments were realized with 86 students from the Computer Engineering and Systems Analysis courses offered by Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Paraná (UTFPR), Campus of Cornelio Procópio.
In the year 2013 and 2014, the authors carried out 6 experiments using Mindstorms as the object of software process and project management teaching and learning, with the duration of 345 minutes each.
One experiment was realized with 4 high school students and, finally, one in a company from the software production sector (4 collaborators).
During the experiment carried out in a traditional way - Phase A-64.
To verify whether Mindstorms promotes motivation in transferring knowledge about software process and project management, the authors of this paper mapped the level of satisfaction of the participants in the experiment - Phase B.
The data experiment testified its rationality and feasibility of this multi-information integrated model.
[4] Specification document is used as a contract between client and developer organization and use to derive design and test cases as well.
 At later stages, enormous errors would be generated as soon as the code is completed, where it demands a lot of code correction and modification.

 Initially Visual cryptography was associated with embedding of message into the shares generated by visual cryptography algorithms.
 Duplicate acknowledgments (DUP_ACKs) generated by the receiver will then trigger unnecessary TCP congestion control at the sender.
 If that is deemed due to a transient network failure, no DUP_ACK will be generated.
 The client information stored in the table is the IP address and the SYN count.
 We conducted experiments to compare the performances of CW-TCP/IP, Linux TCP/IP and muC/TCP-IP of muC/OS-II, which is widely used as an OS for small embedded systems.
 Finally the directions for improving this algorithm are pointed out.
 The elaborated report is finally displayed on the public area to make it accessible to the teachers and all the learners.
 Finally, the target data are augmented with the selected features before training.
 The experiments are conducted on the public dataset.
 The success of the adversary is measured by similarity of labels returned by the classifier under attack and the classifier that is built by the adversary.

 Experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed model with synthetic data set.
However, discrepancy-based recommendations require more sophistication than traditional recommendations from online stores (see [7] for more details): Explicit user selections (A, B, C) are stored in a database.
 Compared with the information retrieval system, the intelligent recommendation system takes some user data as input, finds out the interests of the user after specific computing, and finally recommends information to the user based on the interests.
We perform experiments in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for the task of news recommendation and show that our method performs 5.8% better than the baseline in terms of Hit Ratio@ 10.
 In the experiment, we analyze the efficiency of two algorithms and compare the recommended routes with each other under different user preferences or different constraints.
 The cosine similarity calculation is performed on the topic distribution vector, and the recommended data list is obtained through Top5 calculation.
 The tag is used as information reflecting user interest preferences and resource characteristics.
 In our research, the willingness of each students to a set of learning objects is measured by the attraction and non-attraction degree part and student similarity among students.
Real dataset of 100 students, collected from the Department of Computer Sciences, Quid-i-Azam University is used in experiments.
 Experiment with weibo datasets shows performance improvement on friend recommendation.
 Degree of intimacy is measured with the number of social links which has disadvantages in depending on the user's activity.
 P-trees can be generated quite quickly and can be viewed as a “data mining ready” and lossless format for storing spatial or any relational data.
 Experiments were carried out with extensive tweet data set.
 To evaluate the performance of ISVM real image experiments are conducted in comparison with state-of-the-art spectral-spatial hyperspectral classification methods.
 Experiments are carried out using the ISMIR2004 GENRE database with 6 types of music genres and about 1458 music clips.
 Experiments of PC-HGA algorithm are carried out on two benchmark datasets: iris and dermatology from UCI machine-learning repository.
 This algorithm identified the mixed pixels and more accurate statistical parameters are generated.
 To evaluate the classification performance, a speech/music classification task is carried out wherein a support vector machine (SVM) is used as the classifier.
 At the same time, the algorithm greatly reduces the consumption of human resources generated by manual labeling samples.
Clustering reduces the size of the routing table stored at the individual nodes by localizing the route set up within the cluster.
 The experiments are conducted on number of web services and the efficiency is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and run time.
